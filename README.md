Rawr - A Halloween Noisemaker for iOS
=====================================

My daughter dressed as a dinosaur for Halloween; this is the app she used with an iPhone 3GS in her pocket (and a speaker and made-by-me amp in the costume) to make the sound. I didn't stop there, however; I added a little extra Halloween fun, giving myself the ability to make the iPhone laugh maniacally or scream by sending push notifications. It was a lot of fun enjoyed by all!

## Requirements
Requires iOS 5.0 or later. Compatible with iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch. Internet connection required to receive push notifications.

You will need a way to send push notifications; a script is included to enable this via Amazon Web Services' Simple Notification Service (SNS).
